The "Driver Coach" is a system that will help the driver of a car to improve its safety by providing feedback just like any regular coach. 
The system is based on a camera and sensors that monitor the driver's behaviour during a road trip.

### Following a step by step approach

Developing a driver monitoring system is not a trivial task. And there are several ways to get there. 
The easiest is of course just to buy such a system from a reliable supplier or develop one using a toolkit. 
But this may be expensive or not suit your needs. And how do you get the expertise to choose the right solution?
I decided to try to develop one myself to see how far I can come. Its an interesting project.

* Develop a basic prototype
    * learn more about the subject of safe driving, sensors, data processing, machine learning
    * find out if its possible to develop a cost effective solution
    * demonstrate its capabilities
* If this first step succeeds, try to interest parties to actually develop and use such systems
* If not then I have lost nothing and learned a lot.

|Use case|Business case|
|----------|-----------|
|* Promote safe driving habits|* Car lease (safety as a service, reduce car accidents)
| * Improve safe driving behaviour|* Insurance (reduce car accidents)
| * Help to prevent car accidents|* Road service organizations (safety for its members)
| * Make Driver Monitoring systems available for low cost|
| * Lower costs for society|

When a driver enters the car he/she is automatically recognized.
During the trip the system continuously determines the actual driving situation (parked, cruising, braking, turning) and evaluates the drivers activity and behaviour.
It provides an audible warning when the driver gets tired and requires a break.
It immediately alerts the driver when a dangerous situation occurs, such as texting while driving. 

After each trip the system sends a summary to the driver's smartphone for quick review. When at home specific situations can be reviewed in depth with the Driving Coach App. The App will show snapshots or short video with detailed data and advise for improvement.

The collected data is kept on the device under full control of the driver and can be deleted when required. Data can be shared anonymously for specific applications such as a safe driver leader board  where drivers can compare themselves with other drivers.

## Monitor driver behavior

  * Good driving habits
    * Wearing seat belt
    * Active driving posture
    * Hands on the steering wheel
    * Looking to the general driving direction
    * Checking for traffic from all directions
    * Left/right/rear mirror checking
   * Abstain from distractions
     * Mobile phone usage (handheld, call, texting)
     * Operating the radio / airco
     * Talking to passengers
     * Eating or drinking
     * Other (looking for something, singing)
   * Driver physics
     * Body, arm and hand position
     * Head pose (rotation, looking direction)
     * Driver drowsiness
       * Eye blinking/closed
       * Head bobbing
       * Mouth yawning

 ## Challenges
 
 * Specification (domain knowledge)
 * System limitations (processing power, battery consumption, operating system)
 * Physical conditions
    * Lighting conditions
    * Vibrations
    * Mounting (where, how, car types)
 * Calibration & Testing (test data)
 * Legal issues
 
 
## Tools and technology
 
 * Driver Sensors
    * Face location (is there a driver)
    * Driver recognition (who is driving)
    * Head Pose estimation (looking direction)
    * Face landmarks (eyes, mouth)
    * Hand location (on steering wheel)
    * Image classification of dangerous situations
 * Vehicle sensors
    * Acceleration (left/right turn, breaking)
    * Vehicle speed
