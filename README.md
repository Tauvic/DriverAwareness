# Driver Safety Awareness project

Driver Monitoring System

Goals:
* Promote safe driving habits
* Raise awareness
* Change driver behaviour
* Help to prevent car accidents

The Driver Monitoring System is based on a camera that monitors the driver's behaviour during a road trip. When the driver enters the car he / she is recognized or a new profile is created for analyzing drivers performance.
The system provides immediate feedback on positive and negative behaviour. It warns when the driver gets tired and requires a break. It immediately alerts the driver when a dangerous situation occurs, suc as texting while driving). 
After each trip the system analyses the data and generates a report that can be send to the drivers smartphone. The driver can then review its own behaviour and adjust it to improve its safety.
